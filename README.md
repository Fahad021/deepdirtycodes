Experimental and exercising codes for deep learning.

## Word2Vec

Tutorial codes for training word2vec embeddings with the Skip-Gram model.

Run the script - ```python word2vec.py```

The code is from the [Tensorflow Word2Vec Tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/word2vec) ([Github repo](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/r1.3/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/word2vec)), with minor adaptions.

A very detailed explanation of the code, also a more noob-friendly tutorial of word2vec word embedding, can be found [here](http://adventuresinmachinelearning.com/word2vec-tutorial-tensorflow/).

## RNN and LSTM

A serie of detailed technical tutorials of RNN and LSTM is found [here](https://medium.com/@erikhallstrm/hello-world-rnn-83cd7105b767)

Run the scripts
- ```rnn_echo.py``` A simple recurrent neural network learning a time-series of numbers echoing with fixed time delay.
